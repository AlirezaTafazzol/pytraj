* calling the same Action twice will get segmentation fault
    act = adict['hbond']
    act("", traj)
    act("series", traj)
* if we keep calling the same method, such as "calc_radgyr" many times, the
 timing is slower (might be memory problem)
* traj += traj
    * solution: traj += traj[:]
* act.do_action(traj.chunk_iter()) does not properly work (no frame action is perfomed)
    * solution: use list or tuple (why this works?)
          act.do_action([traj.chunk_iter()])
