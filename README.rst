Welcom to pytraj!

Why bother using pytraj?

    * It's fast (it's a wrapper of cpptraj (was written in C++))
    * It has interface with numpy. Data calculation are performed without copying to numpy array
    * It has clean syntax of Python/Cython
    * It has been extensively tested
    * It's flexible (you can write extension modules in either high (Python) or low (C/C++ or Cython) level)
