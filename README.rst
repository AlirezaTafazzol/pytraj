Welcom to pytraj!

Python API for cpptraj library: a data analysis package for biomolecular simulation

Why bother using pytraj?

    It's fast (it's a wrapper of cpptraj (was written in C++) 
    It has interface with numpy. Data calculation are performed without copying to numpy array
    It has clean syntax of Python/Cython
    It has been extensively testes
    It's flexible (you can write extension modules in either high (Python) or low (C/C++ or Cython) level)
