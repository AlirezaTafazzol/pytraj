Installation
============

Requires
--------
+ Python 3.
+ `numpy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_
+ `cython <http://cython.org/>`_

How?
----

``pytraj`` is stil in alpha phase, you should install from ``github``::

    git clone https://github.com/Amber-MD/pytraj
    cd pytraj
    python ./setup.py install

or from ``conda``::

    conda install -c pytraj pytraj-dev --force

install anaconda for all python packages
----------------------------------------

we highly recommend to install anaconda that has all good python packages (``numpy``, ``sklearn``, ``pandas``, ...). Anaconda is totally free.

+ go to `its website <http://continuum.io/downloads#py34>`_, choose your platform and
  python version. It's better to pick up Python3
+ download file: For example, we downloaded ``Anaconda3-2.1.0-Linux-x86_64.sh``
+ just run ``bash Anaconda3-2.1.0-Linux-x86_64.sh`` and follow instruction. That's it.
