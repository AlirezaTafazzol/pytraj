**pytraj** is a Python front-end package of the popular `cpptraj <http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ct400341p>`_ program.

Why bother using **pytraj**? 
----------------------------

If you want to extend cpptraj's functionanity to Python eco-system such as `numpy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_, `scipy <http://www.scipy.org/>`_, `pandas <http://pandas.pydata.org/>`_, `sklearn <http://scikit-learn.org/stable/>`_ and many more. Check some examples `here <tutorials/mdtraj_adapted>`_

What does **pytraj** offer? 
---------------------------

+ `support many types of analysis <analysis>`_
+ `support parallel processing <parallel>`_
+ :ref:`able to handle many files at the same time <process_many_files>`
+ `able to handle very large trajectory <design_trajectory>`_
+ simple (and fast) calculation::

   import pytraj as pt
   traj = pt.iterload('traj.nc', 'my_parm.top')
   pt.radgyr(traj)

+ include many cpptraj features
    + automatic file detection by its **content**
    + smart ``autoimage`` function for PBC simulation.
    + ... (to be filled soon) 
+ `able to be used in other langues, such as Julia <julia>`_

How to get started
------------------

+ `check installation <installation>`_
+ `learn in 5 minutes <five_minutes>`_
+ do some :ref:`tutorials`
+ `check a list of things pytraj/cpptraj can do <analysis>`_
